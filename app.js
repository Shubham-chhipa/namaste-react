const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("header"))  //Creating a root comes from ReactDOM//when we ar creating a root using a DOM element(document.getElementById("root")) and renedering something inside it then it is the job of ReactDOM //Whenn we want to put our H1 into our DOM/browser so we use ReactDOM
//In ReactJS, the root refers to the place in your HTML where your entire React application will be rendered.
//ReactDOM.createRoot(...): This creates a React root using that DOM element. It's essentially the entry point for the React app into the HTML page.
//So, root here is a React root object that controls rendering of React components inside the DOM element with ID "root".
////React.createElement() creates a react element which is a normal javascript object. In this case it an object of type: "h1". It has something known as props: its attributes + Children

// ðŸ“Œ Why do we need a root?
// React needs to connect to the actual HTML page somehow. Thatâ€™s what the root is for:
// Itâ€™s the bridge between React's virtual DOM and the browser's actual DOM.
// ReactDOM will take your React components/elements (like heading in your case) and render them inside this root element in the real HTML.

// ðŸ“¦ ReactDOM vs React
// React: Used to create elements/components (React.createElement)
// ReactDOM: Responsible for rendering those elements into the actual DOM (ReactDOM.createRoot(...).render(...))

console.log(parent) ////React.createElement() creates a react element which is a normal javascript object. In this case it an object of type: "h1". It has something known as props: its attributes + Children

//root.render(heading)  //renedering our heading inside root
//This render method will take this object and convert it into html tag and put it into the page/DOM

root.render(parent)
